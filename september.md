> Lyrics

Do you remember  
The 21st night of September?  
- Love was changin' the minds of pretenders  
- While chasin' the clouds away  

Our hearts were ringin'  
In the key that our souls were singin'  
1) As we danced in the night, remember  
2) How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah  

`Hey, hey, hey`
```
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
```
